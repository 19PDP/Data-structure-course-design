Based on the time series AR model, principal component 
analysis comprehensive evaluation model, time series 
ARIMA (p, d, q) model, AHP model, and data visualization 
analysis methods, through the processing and prediction 
of relevant quantitative data, comprehensively evaluate 
the directly impacts of the two candidates election, 
Trump and Biden, on the U.S. and China's economy, and 
then analyze the indirectly impacts on it caused by the 
election results. Last, according to the results of election, 
optimized and suggestions are made on China's economic 
countermeasures and policies.
For part 1, quantitatively analyze the possible impact of 
different candidates on the U.S. economy. We use total tax 
revenue, total net exports, employment rate, the growth 
rate of GDP, DJIA, and average hourly earnings as six 
indicators to reflect the U.S. economy. We use a time 
series AR model to predict them in the next four quarters. 
Established the principal component analysis comprehensive 
evaluation system model to precise judge the impact, the 
comprehensive evaluation scores of Trump in the next four 
quarters are -0.2089, -0.1906, 0.6325 and 1.0449; while, 
Biden's are -0.1301, -0.1687, 0.1099 and 0.8567. the difference 
is not very big, so we concluded that no matter Trump or Biden 
is elected, the impact on the U.S. economy is basically the same. 
But the election of Biden is more conducive to short-term 
economic recovery, while Trump is more conducive to long-term 
economic development.
In addition, based on their different political positions and 
policies, making supplementary analysis of COVID-19 response 
measures, immigration policies, economic and employment policies, 
and tax policies through data visualization.
For part 2, quantitatively analyze the possible impact of 
different candidates on China's economy. The total net exports 
which China trade to the United States is used as an indicator to 
judge influence on China's economy, and the ARIMA (p, d, q) model 
is used to predict the qualities of net exports of different 
candidates' election in the next four quarters. The forecast result 
shows that if Biden is elected, the net export forecasts for the 
four quarters of the next year are 806.6279, 623.7142, 811.5738, and 
896.0007 billion U.S. dollars.
